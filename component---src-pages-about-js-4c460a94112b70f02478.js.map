I am Synwrks (short for Synesthetic Works): a digital artist, DJ, and music producer dedicated to bringing more \"synesthesia\" to the dance floor and beyond.</p>\r\n    <p>My journey as a DJ began in southern Italy in the early 2000s. Back then, I used to bring student parties and birthdays to life with a combination of lights and sound, requiring a frenzied manipulation of switches and faders. While carefully synchronizing music, colors, and smoke machines I started fantasizing about better ways to maximize the expressive potential of synergy between the senses.</p>\r\n    <p>Over the next 10+ years, work and life events forced me to put my DJing on hold. I however seized any available moment to build tools and develop processes for creating visual experiences inspired by synesthesia. This ranged from composing original soundtracks for shorts and ads, to crafting 3D VR music videos that garnered enthusiastic viewers among the early adopters of the \"metaverse\". For example, one of my videos was featured in Oculus Quest 2 as \"demo content\" when the headset first launched!</p>\r\n    <p>During the pandemic I embarked on the latest phase of my artistic research: crafting procedurally visualized, hours-long DJ mixes that transport viewers as if sticking their heads through a Stargate. It was at this point that my digital art found live audiences through music events in San Francisco and exciting raid trains on Twitch.</p>\r\n    <p>In terms of regular engagements, I am proud to be a resident DJ/VJ at the super-inspiring Secret Psychedelica parties held in DNA Lounge, an iconic San Francisco venue. Additionally, I am grateful to be part of the Joyride Express family, a group of legendary DJs hosting shows every Thursday on Twitch.</p>\r\n    <p>Thank you for reading this far. Don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to discuss potential projects, ask questions about my work, or anything in-between!</p>\r\n  </Layout>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\";\r\nimport SEO from \"../components/seo\"\r\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\r\n\r\nconst BlogHeader = (props) => \r\n    <span className=\"blog-header\">\r\n      <SEO title={props.title} image={props.ogimage}/>\r\n      <h2>\r\n        <span className=\"back-button\"><Link>&#x2039;</Link></span>\r\n        {props.title}\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <h3>{props.date}</h3>\r\n    </span>\r\n\r\nBlogHeader.propTypes = {\r\n  title: PropTypes.string,\r\n  date: PropTypes.string,\r\n  ogimage: PropTypes.string\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default BlogHeader;"],"sourceRoot":""}
