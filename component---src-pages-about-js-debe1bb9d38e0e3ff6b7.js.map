I'm based in San Francisco (California).</p>\r\n    <p>I have been experimenting with electronic music production for as long as I can remember, and my experiences with DJing go back to many years ago, when I was a high school student in Italy (my country of origin).</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>It is more recently however (about 2016) that I embarked in the Synesthetic Works project, combining my passion for music with my love for visual arts and technology, with the aim to represent the experience of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">synesthesia</a>. This later got abbreviated into my art name \"Synwrks\", as I began to perform live VJ and DJ sets at various events in the Bay Area.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>My works include original music, VR music videos, looping visuals and \"synesthetic\" DJ sets (hours-long DJ sets that are fully visualized to precisely match the beats and feeling of each track). I create through abundant use of software prototypes and procedural techniques, mostly involving 3D animation but lately also including dashes of generative AI.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I am a resident DJ and VJ at the psytrance-focused monthly <i>Secret Psychedelica</i> parties held in DNA Lounge, an iconic San Francisco venue. Additionally, you can find me streaming every week on Twitch raid trains like the <i>Joyride Express</i> (as resident) or PsyLife, OMFG!, Fundamental, Momentum and others. I also perform at other events as the occasions present themselves, ranging from lovely gatherings in the nature like Bare Burn to bigger city parties like How Weird Street Faire.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If you'd like to see me perform in a venue or event near you, check out the <Link to=\"/bookings\">Bookings</Link> page for more information!</p>\r\n  </Layout>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\";\r\nimport SEO from \"../components/seo\"\r\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\r\n\r\nconst BlogHeader = (props) => \r\n    <span className=\"blog-header\">\r\n      <SEO title={props.title} image={props.ogimage}/>\r\n      <h2>\r\n        <span className=\"back-button\"><Link>&#x2039;</Link></span>\r\n        {props.title}\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <h3>{props.date}</h3>\r\n    </span>\r\n\r\nBlogHeader.propTypes = {\r\n  title: PropTypes.string,\r\n  date: PropTypes.string,\r\n  ogimage: PropTypes.string\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default BlogHeader;"],"sourceRoot":""}
