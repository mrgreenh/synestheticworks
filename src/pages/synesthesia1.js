    <p>This is the first of what I hope will be many similar projects. I “hope” because then you know, life happens, or laziness, or carpal tunnel etc... So I’m thankful already I got the bandwidth and peace of mind necessary to work on this first one.
The idea is: augment the experience of producing music, by adding a compelling visual dimension to it. Such visual dimension is supposed to be engaging and fully expressive (not having to compromise too much in terms of visual quality/realism/abstraction) and is enabled by the data typically available to electronic music producers (MIDI + audio + automations).
This first project itself had the objective of paving a workflow that would make it possible to produce this kind of content single-handedly, on a regular basis (2-3 months cycles?), thus maintaining the personal nature of “bedroom music production”.</p>
