          It's easy! Two ways really:

              If you have an Oculus Quest Headset, you can easily save it at
              this link, and find it in the "Saved" tab in Oculus TV:{" "}

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>For best visual quality</strong>: click on the 3 dots
                  icon on the video's thumbnail, and select "Cache High
                  Quality".

            </li>
            <li>
              If you have any other VR headset, you can watch it on YouTube VR,
              add it to a playlist to find it more easily:{" "}

            This is a 180 3D video, so don't forget to look around. Use
            headphones if you can ;)

      <h3>Notes About the Process</h3>
      <p>
        This video is quite a departure from the previous two: while those
        evolved gradually through some sort of narrative, this one looks more
        like a "reel" collecting various independent works implementing common
        aesthetic rules. This is the result of a choice to invest more towards
        the "process" than the ideal characteristics of any specific final
        result. At the same time the same process leverages modularity to
        produce a wider number of diverse outcomes (like the visual DJ mixes,
        also posted on this site).
      </p>
      <p>
        In previous videos a large amount of effort would go towards scripting
        the 3D rendering software itself to produce a very specific journey for
        a very specific song. In this new process instead, the 3D renderings aim
        at capturing the array of feelings evoked by the music genre at large,
        while following some common rules on style (e.g. forward-scrolling
        sci-fi landscapes), format (seamless loops), implementation (how to
        divide composable layers) etc... It then recycles the same software
        prototype used for the previous Synesthesias to translate MIDI and
        waveforms into animation envelopes (let's call this "Synesthetizer").
      </p>
      <p>
        The new software component prototyped for this process is an application
        that interfaces with all the elements mentioned above, and presents them
        through a simple GUI (let's call this "Composer"). In fact, this video
        hasn't been made with any commercial video editor. Both the "flat" and
        the VR versions of First Flight are the direct output of this prototype.
        Both the Composer and the Synesthetizer can also work together as a
        batch video creation tool (for creating the visuals used in the DJ
        mixes). Finally, one very useful functionality is offered by not
        grounding a project on settings like resolution or aspect ratio: the
        same project outputs both the "flat" and the VR renderings, just by
        flipping a couple switches.
      </p>
      <p>
        The surprising (and hoped for) result has been the malleability with
        which these diverse inputs (flat loops, VR loops, DJing songs library,
        personal music productions) can be intertwined like lego bricks, to
        produce the visual DJ mixes, the synesthetic journeys, and more things
        yet to try. The fulfilling aspect of this isn't necessarily the quality
        of every single final output, but rather the range of what can be
        visualized (low-input data granularity / long duration on one side, high
        input data granularity / short duration on the other) and the ease with
        which it can be done. In addition to that, the various aspects of the
        creative process are set free to evolve independently: the 3D landscapes
        can aim specifically at visual impact, while the electronic music track
        can similarly be built around what's best for the song. In the end, a
        melancholic opening will find a subdued landscape to go with, and a
        high-energy drop will find a flashing geometry to follow its beat.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end this process goes a long way towards finding "flow" in each
        of its individual steps, while obtaining a "good enough" range of
        results in the end. As for everything, it's the journey that matters.
        Speaking of journeys, I hope you'll enjoy this one.
